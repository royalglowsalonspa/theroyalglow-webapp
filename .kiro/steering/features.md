## Customer Booking Flow

### 4-Step Dialog (over homepage, NOT a separate page)

1. **Branch + Details + Date/Slot** — name/email prefilled (not editable), date picker, time slot
2. **Choose Categories** — Salon/SPA toggle (one type per booking), multi-select categories
3. **Choose Services** — Service cards with multi-select, running total at bottom
4. **Summary** — "Booking Submitted!" (status: pending), services list, total, payment note

**Entry points:**
- Homepage "Book Now" button → opens dialog
- `/?book=1` deep-link → auto-opens dialog
- `/?book=1&utm_source=gmb` → dialog + source attribution
- `/?book=1&utm_source=walkin` → dialog + walk-in attribution

**NEVER redirect to `/book`** from homepage CTAs. `/book` is Meta ad lead capture only.

### Booking Numbering

Format: `BK-{branch_code}-{YYMM}-{H|S}-{5_random}[-M]`
- H = salon (hair/beauty), S = spa
- -M suffix for membership sessions

---

## Admin Portal (RBAC)

### Role Hierarchy

```
Developer → Owner → Manager → Receptionist → Staff → Customer
```

### Key Route → Role Mapping

| Route | Min. Role |
|-------|-----------|
| `/admin` (dashboard) | Receptionist |
| `/admin/bookings` | Receptionist |
| `/admin/customers`, `/admin/leads` | Receptionist |
| `/admin/billing` | Receptionist |
| `/admin/services`, `/admin/offers` | Manager |
| `/admin/staff`, `/admin/schedule` | Manager |
| `/admin/reports` | Manager |
| `/admin/settings`, `/admin/branches` | Manager (branches: Owner) |
| `/admin/users` | Owner |
| `/admin/integrations`, `/admin/logs` | Developer |

---

## SPA Memberships

- **Tiers:** Silver (8hrs/₹10k/90d), Gold (15hrs/₹15k/90d), Platinum (custom)
- **Access:** All SPA services in any tier — hours are the only constraint
- **Session recording:** Admin records → booking(completed, ₹0) + membership_session invoice
- **No gems** on purchase OR sessions
- **One active per customer** (DB constraint)
- **Hard expiry** with reminders at 30d/7d/1d

---

## Lead Pipeline (`/book` → Meta Ad Leads)

```
Meta ad → theroyalglow.in/book → 3-field form (name, phone, service)
  → POST /api/leads → lead row (source: meta_ad) + CAPI Lead event
  → Redirect to /?book=1&leadId={id}
  → Customer books → lead.converted_booking_id set → status: booked
```

**Lead statuses:** New → Contacted → Follow-up → Booked → Won/Lost

---

## Offers & Combos

- **Types:** percentage, flat, combo_price
- **Rules:** 1 offer/customer/day, applied at checkout by receptionist, cannot combine with gems
- **Salon only** (not SPA memberships)
- Auto-expire via pg_cron Job 3

---

## No-Show Policy

| Count | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 1-3 | CRM tag "No-Show Risk", no restriction |
| 4+ (within 90 days) | `booking_requires_approval = true` → Manager must approve |
| Recovery | 3 consecutive completed bookings → reset |

Walk-in no-shows do NOT count toward the tier.
